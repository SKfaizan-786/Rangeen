SAR Image Colourization with Deep Learning
This project uses deep learning models like Pix2Pix and cGAN to colorize SAR images, improving their interpretability and usefulness in areas like:

Disaster Management
Geological Mapping
Environmental Monitoring
The colorized images provide clearer insights, making them more effective for spaceborne applications.
